      <h1>Project Overview:</h1>

      <p class="project-description">
        As a part of my Masters research work at Carnegie Mellon University, I developed a custom manipulator capable of
        grasping crop leaves (similar to corn and sorghum). This manipulator is primarily designed to apply a
        reflectance spectrometer sensor to the surface of leaves to take rapid, autonomous spectral
        scans of crops. This leaf grasper was mounted to the pre-existing arm on the ground robot previously developed
        as a part of the same robotic crop phenotyping research project.

      <p class="project-description">
        The first robotic manipulator on the mobile robotic platform was designed to detect and grasp sorghum stalks.The
        end effector consisted of two aluminum fingers that when actuated would enclose the stalk against the end of the
        arm. A rind penetrometer, or small needle connected to a force gauge, was then applied to the sorghum stalks.
        The force to penetrate the stalk wall with this needle was then recorded and used to predict stalk strength, a
        key trait used by plant geneticists in improving overall yield of the crop. The entire robotic arm and custom
        stalk grasping manipulator was designed by Merritt Jenkins, a past graduate student in robotics at Carnegie
        Mellon, whose works is detailed in his <a

        <h1>System Requirements:</h1>
      </a>

      <p class="project-description">
        When the notion of robotic leaf grasping was first proposed within the scope of this project, it was immediately
        made clear that any new manipulator must be heavily derived from the previous stalk gripping manipulator. This
        was mainly the case to keep costs low while also limiting any significant change to the design of the mobile
        robot base. A functioning custom robotic arm along with software to control it was already in place, so
        recycling as much of this work into a new leaf grasping manipulator was seen as the best solution. Furthermore,
        if executed properly, the two manipulators could be quickly and easily swapped in and out depending on the task.
        With this challenge in mind, a list of system requirements were created to guide the design and development of
        this custom manipulator.
      </p>

      <ul class="project-description">
        <li><b>System Mass: </b>Less than 20 kg</li>
        <li><b>End Effector Mass: </b>Less than 2 kg</li>
        <li><b>Reach: </b>Must grasp leaves 0.5 m away</li>
        <li><b>Power: </b>Less than 100 W</li>
        <li><b>Sealing: </b>Must be rated for continuous outdoor use</li>
        <li><b>Cost: </b>Less than $1,000 for updates to stalk grasper</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="project-description">
        The overall system mass was determined mainly by the original constraint set in the design of the
        stalk grasping manipulator. Extensive calculations were made by Jenkins to find a system mass and
        geometry that would ensure safe operation of the vertical stage motor and revolute joint actuators even
        under worst case dynamic loading during field testing. Similarly, the new end effector must be under 2 kg in
        mass. The reach capability of 0.5 m easily encompasses leaves to the immediate sides of the robot while
        navigating between crop rows. Similar to the original manipulator power constraint, the new design must take
        less than 100 W to operate in order to maintain current battery life and to not overload the max power ratings
        of the onboard DC-DC converters. The entire arm assembly and end effector must be properly sealed to
        survive continuous and long term outdoor use. As such, the manipulator should survive exposure to dust
        and dirt as well as light splashes. Lastly the updated leaf grasping design must accomplish its goal under all
        the above requirements and constraints for less than $1,000.

      <p class="project-description">
        Given that the primary goal driving the design of this custom manipulator is to grasp leaves, the
        physical grasping mechanism was the first aspect of the system to be considered. The design for a new end
        effector was created that consists of two wide pads that clamp together around a leaf. More specifically, the
        gripper resembles a sort of jaw mechanism where the upper plate is actuated by a servo motor and the bottom
        plate is rigidly attached to the frame of the arm. When the end effector is positioned around a leaf, the top
        plate rotates downward to firmly press the leaf against the rigid bottom plate. A closer view of the end
        effector can be seen in images above.
      </p>

      <p class="project-description">
        This manipulator is also responsible for collecting reflectance spectra of leaves upon grasping.
        Therefore, another key component of the end effector is the way in which it positions fiber optic cables
        directly above the surface of leaves for collection of reflected light. In the images below, it can be seen
        that the upper red pad of the clamping mechanism has a rectangular opening near the top for mounting a
        separate, small adapter plate used to accurately position up to four fiber optic cables. The four cables are
        equally spaced around the circular opening on the flat, bottom face of the adapter plate so that the axis of
        each cable intersects at a common point in the center of this circular opening. Additionally, each cable sits
        at an angle of 45 degrees off of the surface normal of a grasped leaf. Lastly, the exposed end face of each
        fiber is positioned at an axial distance of 2 mm away from the center of the circular opening.

      <p class="project-description">
        In order to provide feedback to the system on whether a leaf was successfully grasped and a
        spectral scan should be performed, an LED is mounted in a small cylindrical housing in the middle of the
        upper red clamp plate which can be seen in the right image above. A light sensor is mounted in a
        small opening along the surface of the rigid bottom plate so that the LED and sensor are positioned
        directly opposite of each other when the plates of the leaf clamp are touching. Therefore, if a leaf is
        between the two plates, the light sensor will detect little to no intensity from the LED and a successful
        grasp can be determined.

      <p class="project-description"><b>Mechanical:</b></p>

      <p class="project-description">
        Just as with the stalk grasping manipulator, this system retains the same three degrees of freedom:
        a vertically mounted linear stage acts as a prismatic joint perpendicular to the ground plane and two HEBI
        X-5 actuators function as revolute joints at the shoulder and elbow of the two link robotic arm. In order to
        satisfy the reach requirement of 0.5 m, the aluminum tubes that make up the two arm frames were
        designed to provide an overall distance of 0.66 m from the axis of rotation of the shoulder joint to the
        center of the clamping plates on the end effector. Furthermore, the entire leaf grasping manipulator has an
        overall system mass of about 2.7 kg which is significantly less than the 20 kg constraints placed on the
        design. This low mass is largely due to the use of thin walled aluminum tubing to form the frame of the
        robotic arm as well as the use of 3D printed ABS plastic components to make up the end effector. In fact
        the entire end effector design has a mass of just under 0.4 kg which again is significantly less than the 2
        kg constraint detailed above. The mechanical components used to actuate the upper plate of the clamping
        mechanism can be seen in the image below.

      <p class="project-description">
        A Tower Pro MG995R high torque servo motor was selected to actuate the upper clamp plate. Although
        servo motors do not typically provide an incredibly robust and durable system for outdoor use, they do
        provide a low cost, light weight solution for actuating small loads with position feedback. This servo provides
        up to 8.5 kg-cm of
        torque at 5 V with a range of about 170 degrees. A shaft coupler connects the typical star toothed output
        shaft of the servo to a 3/16” diameter steel shaft that is secured by a shaft support to prevent any off axis
        bending forces on the servo motor. A set of small, nylon bevel gears transfers the rotary motion 90 degrees to
        another perpendicularly mounted 3/16” steel shaft. This shaft is mounted on each end by
        flanged ball bearings that are secured to the end of the aluminum frame of the forearm. Two custom shaft
        mounts were designed and machined to fit the geometry of the system and mate the upper clamp plate to
        the shaft.
      </p>
      <p class="project-description">
        In order to easily access the electronics and mechanical
        components within this section of the arm, a large cutout was made on the top face of the aluminum tube.
        This large opening is sealed using an ABS plastic plate that fully covers the opening and extends down
        the sides of the frame. Lastly, the opening in the aluminum frame at the leaf clamp end was sealed using a
        custom fit, 3D printed cap insert. This cap is also designed into the
        rigid base plate of the leaf clamp in order take advantage of the ease of complexity that comes with 3D
        printing as well as to reduce the number of overall parts and fasteners in the assembly.
      </p>

      <p class="project-description"><b>Electrical:</b></p>

      <p class="project-description">
        The entire manipulator system can be powered off of 18-36 V and consumes an average of 45 W
        of power. The HEBI X-5 actuators draw an average current of 0.8 A at 24 V with a peak current draw of
        2.4 A. On board regulation allows for these motors to be powered by 18 - 48 V. The servo motor is
        powered off of 5 V, which is provided by a CUI PDQ30-Q24-S5-D DC-DC converter that steps down a
        9-36 V supply to 5 V for the servo. Under maximum loading, the servo draws up to 1.2 A of current. All
        together, each subsystem in the manipulator can be powered off of the unregulated ~24 V supply from the
        robot’s battery.
      </p>
      <p class="project-description">
        An Arduino Nano mounted on a small board behind the servo motor is used to control the motor
        as well as the state of the LED and analog voltage readings from the light sensor. A long USB cable is fed
        through the two aluminum frames and down to a bulkhead connector for communication with one of the
        onboard NUC computers. In a similar fashion, the HEBI actuators communicate with the onboard
        computers through an Ethernet cable that is routed through the robotic arm and down to the robot base.
