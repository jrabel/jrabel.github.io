			<p class="project-description"><b>Project Overview:</b></p>
			<p class="project-description">As a part of my Masters research work at Carnegie Mellon
				University, I developed portable reflectance spectrometer system capable of being mounted to an autonomous
				robotic system to take rapid spectral measurements of the stalks and leaves of various crops. This page details
				the mechanical design, sensor selections, and fabrication process of creating this <b>field reflectance
					spectrometer</b> system.
			</p>

			<p class="project-description"><b>Spectroscopy Overview:</b></p>
			<p class="project-description">At the broadest level, spectroscopy refers to the
				measurement of
				electromagnetic radiation as a function of wavelength or frequency due to
				some physical phenomenon. More specifically, the field of
				spectroscopy attempts to study the specific interaction between matter and light to try to understand the
				atomic and molecular structure and chemical composition of various materials (such as moisture, chlorophyll, and
				protein content).
			</p>
			<p class="project-description">More specifically, reflectance
				spectroscopy is the study of reflected or scattered light from a
				material. Reflectance spectroscopy has a few
				key advantages that make it particularly fit for in-field, automated measurements. Firstly, the process is
				nondestructive to the sample. A reflectance spectrometer can simply be placed up to the surface of a material
				to take a reading, whereas other spectroscopy techniques (absorption and emission spectroscopy)
				usually require lengthy
				and destructive material preparation that must be performed in a laboratory setting. Furthermore, reflectance
				spectroscopy is relatively cheap to perform and readings can be done in a matter of seconds. Therefore,
				reflectance spectroscopy was chosen as a technique for collecting crop data by the autonomous ground robot
				developed in conjunction with my research work at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon.
			</p>

			<p class="project-description">Portable reflectance spectrometers contain three basic
				components used for the measurement of light: a light source, a diffraction grating, and a light sensor or
				detector. The light source provides the initial introduction of radiation that is projected onto the sample. It
				is crucial for the light source to emit a continuous spectrum of radiation that covers the wavelengths measured
				by the spectrometer. The diffraction grating takes in a stream of broadband light and refracts the
				different wavelengths of light at slightly different angles, in essence separating the light so that the sensor
				in the spectrometer can measure the intensity of individual wavelengths. Lastly, the light sensor or
				detector is used to measure the intensity of light projected onto it. These three basic components and how
				they fit into the general construction of a spectrometer can be seen in the figures below. The right figure
				demonstrates a spectrometer system that must be placed on the surface of the sample. The left figure demostrates
				a system that uses a bifurcated fiber optic cable to collect reflected light from a sample.</p>

			<h1>Light Source Design:</h1>

			<p class="project-description">The selection of a proper light source used in a spectrometer is crucial to
				the accuracy and
				consistency of spectral reflectance measurements of a sample. At the most basic level, the light source
				must emit electromagnetic radiation throughout all wavelength bands measured by the sensors in the
				system. Although there are many robust, high quality light source assemblies on the market
				that are
				designed and optimized for spectroscopy applications, these assemblies are often expensive and rather large when
				considering the strict
				size constraints on this spectrometer project. Thus I ultimately decided to design a custom light source
				for the reflectance spectrometer system.

			<p class="project-description"><b>Bulb Selection:</b></p>

			<p class="project-description">
				I selected the Thorlabs HEP3965 Broadband IR Tungsten Bulb, shown in the figure below. This bulb produces a
				broadband output from about 400 to 5000 nm at a color temperature of
				1900 K, resulting in a peak intensity right around 1500 nm. The bulb comes mounted in a small TO-8 can
				with a reflector placed behind the filament for greater forward facing luminous flux. The bulb can be
				driven up to 3.5 V with a maximum current of 2 A resulting in a maximum power rating of 7 W.
				Furthermore, this bulb comes with a threaded mounting adapter allowing for easy
				installation into Thorlabs lens tubes. These components allow for greater precision in filament alignment and
				imaging onto the end of the optical fiber.

				<li>(b) <b>Thorlabs SM1RC and TR1</b> - SM1 Lens tube slip ring and vertical mounting post</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="project-description">
				As seen in the exploded view above, the tungsten bulb <b>(h)</b> rests inside a thick, circular adapter plate
				<b>(i)</b>
				with external threading. This adapter plate is then mounted inside a heat sink style lens tube <b>(g)</b> with
				many radial fins for added heat expulsion and greater convective cooling during use. Because the interior
				of the heat sink lens tube and the exterior of the bulb adapter plate are both finely threaded, the position of
				the bulbs filament along the axis of the tube can be precisely controlled. Attached to the front face of the
				heat sink lens tube is a short mounting tube <b>(f)</b> for an N-BK7, a type of borosilicate glass, biconvex
				lens
				<b>(e)</b>. The next component along the optical axis is a two inch long lens tube <b>(c)</b> to properly space
				the lens
				from the optical fiber. On the end of the lens tube spacer is a threaded cap <b>(a)</b> with an SMA fiber
				connecter to attach a fiber optic cable for light collection. The entire assembly is held in space by a
				vertical mounting post with a large slip ring <b>(b)</b> that tightly hugs the two inch lens tube. This vertical
				mounting post can be fastened to the base plate of the spectrometer housing for rigid attachment within
				the larger system.
