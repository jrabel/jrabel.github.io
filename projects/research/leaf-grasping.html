            <h1>Overview:</h1>

            <p class="project-description">
                In order to grasp sorghum (and corn) leaves using the custom manipulator developed in
                <a href="../hardware/leaf-gripper.html" style="color: #00CED1;">"Robotic Leaf Grasping Manipulator"</a>,
                a valid grasp pose must first be determined. This process in large part depends on the inverse
                kinematics of the manipulator as well as the pose of the target object. Once a set of leaves have been
                detected using the process described in
                <a href="../research/leaf-detection.html" style="color: #00CED1;">"Real-Time Leaf Detection Using
                    Stereo Camera"</a>, we can use the estimated 3D models of the leaves to calculate "optimal" grasp
                poses. This page details the challenges from the limited degrees of freedom of the custom manipulator
                and then describes algorithms used to quantify the quality of various potential grasp poses.
            </p>

            <h1>Constraints Due to Limited Degrees of Freedom:</h1>

            <p class="project-description">
                In most robotic manipulation tasks, grasp point detection is based heavily on the geometry and
                pose of the target object. It is also the case that the kinematics of the robotic manipulator have a
                significant impact on the feasibility of detected grasp points. For example, a robotic arm with six or
                more degrees of freedom can essentially move its end effector to any position and orientation within the
                reach of the robot, making almost all detected grasp points in the scene feasible. However, given a
                manipulator with a limited number of degrees of freedom, a subset of seemingly ideal grasp points may
                be unachievable. In the case of our custom leaf grasping manipulator, only three degrees of freedom are
                used to move the leaf clamp end effector to a potential grasp point. The kinematics of this custom
                manipulator allow for the positioning of the end effector to any point in 3D space but the resulting
                orientation is uncontrollable and dictated by the system geometry, as shown in the figure below.
                Therefore, the manipulator may position the leaf clamp at a grasp point, but the resulting angle of the
                clamp may make a successful grasp impractical or even impossible.

            <h1>Graspability Metric:</h1>

            <p class="project-description">
                Given the challenges and constraints from the limited degrees of freedom of the manipulator, it is
                convenient to develop a graspability metric that proactively ranks the feasibility of various grasp
                poses. Therefore, the best grasp poses can be extracted from a large set of poses along a leaf based on
                the points that rank the highest in terms of graspability. Naturally, the question then arises, what
                defines graspability in this context? Here, graspability is defined as a measure of the quality of a
                leafâ€™s pose as it relates to the kinematics and constraints of the manipulator. The remainder of this
                section is dedicated to creating a compact function, called the <b>graspability function</b>, that will
                produce a normalized score that reflects the estimated quality of a grasp at a specified point along the
                leaf. In order to develop this function, some standard notation must first be considered. In the figure
                below, a sample leaf is shown along with various detected leaf points along its surface.

                At each leaf point, <code>r</code>, three unit vectors are present: the surface normal,
                <code>s&#x0302<sub>r</sub></code>, the tangent vector, <code>t&#x0302<sub>r</sub></code>, and the plane
                normal, <code>p&#x0302<sub>r</sub></code>. When a leaf is detected from the parabolic RANSAC leaf
                detection algorithm described in

                    Stereo Camera"</a>,
                these three unit vectors are calculated for each point as follows. The plane
                normal, <code>p&#x0302<sub>r</sub></code>, has actually already been found in Step 1b in the parabolic
                RANSAC algorithm. The tangent vector, <code>t&#x0302<sub>r</sub></code>, is found by solving for the
                vector between the current point, <code>r<sub>k</sub></code>, and a neighboring point,
                <code>r<sub>k+1</sub></code> then normalizing as shown in the equation:

            <p class="project-description">
                Lastly, the surface normal, <code>s&#x0302<sub>r</sub></code>, can then be found by taking the cross
                product between the tangent vector and the plane normal, as shown in the equation below, to create an
                orthogonal set of axes centered at the leaf point.

            <p class="project-description">
                Also of importance is the end effector vector, <code>c&#x0302<sub>r</sub></code>, a unit vector whose
                direction is parallel with the length of the last link of the manipulator when the end effector has
                reached the leaf point. The calculation of this vector comes from the inverse kinematics of the
                manipulator and is shown in the section titled "Inverse Kinematics of Manipulator" below.

            <p class="project-description">
                Next, it is useful to create a binary function, <code>g<sub>r</sub></code> , which determines whether a
                leaf point is graspable given its surface normal. This is necessary as portions of a leaf with a large
                angle between the surface normal and vertical vector cannot be grasped by the end effector. In other
                words, the more vertical a part of the leaf becomes, the more difficult it is to grasp with the leaf
                gripper. This binary grasp function is shown below:

                Here, the <code>Î¸<sub>max</sub></code> parameter can be set to create a threshold on leaf points that
                are considered graspable based on the angle the surface normal makes with the vertical vector. During
                testing of the manipulator in the field, a value of Ï€/3 or 60 degrees was used for
                <code>Î¸<sub>max</sub></code>. The figure below provides a visualization of the raw point cloud shown in
                green as well as the surface normals of all detected leaf points. The surface normals are shown in
                yellow if they are considered graspable by the binary graspability function and red if they are

                This function essentially outputs a normalized score that evaluates the quality of a grasp based on
                the angle between the end effector vector and the plane normal as well as the angle between the surface
                normal and the vertical vector. The first dot product term,
                <code>|c&#x0302<sub>r</sub>Â·p&#x0302<sub>r</sub>|</code>, returns a value between zero and one
                where an output of zero represents a 90 degree difference between the end effector and the plane normal,
                and an output of one represents the case where the vectors are parallel, the best scenario. Here,
                <code>Î±</code> is known as the <i>yaw error gain</i> and varies the effect that this angle difference
                has on the overall output. Similarly, the second dot product term,
                <code>|s&#x0302<sub>r</sub>Â·z&#x0302<sub>g</sub>|</code>, returns a value between zero and one where an
                output of zero represents a 90 degree difference between the surface normal and the vertical vector, and
                an output of one represents the case where the vectors are parallel, the best scenario. <code>Î²</code>

                <code>g<sub>r</sub>(s&#x0302<sub>r</sub>)</code>, is again the
                binary grasp function which will cause the entire equation to equal zero when a point is determined to
                be ungraspable. When a point is graspable, the binary grasp function has no effect on the score. To

                The inverse kinematics are solved online in C++ on an Intel NUC i7 processor in an average of about 50
                microseconds. During the grasp point detection pipeline, the two joint angles are calculated for each of
                the potential grasp points in the scene. With an average of about 200 potential grasp points, the entire
                process of solving the inverse kinematics for all points takes about 10 milliseconds or one
                one-hundredth of a second.
