					<p class="project-tile-description">This Frisbee Simulator accurately models the flight of a frisbee.
						By
						deriving the translational and rotational dynamics of a frisbee flying through the air, I developed
						equations of motion that were then mapped to a state space model that was integrated forward in time
						using MATLAB to solve for the pose of the disc as a function of time. I also used optimization
						techniques to solve for an initial set of throwing parameters to aim a frisbee throw to a target
						somewhere in 3D space. More details regarding my project, including videos, can be found below.</p>

						grasp an object. The snake robot consists of a serial chain of kinematic links, of arbitrary number
						and
						length, where each joint is controlled with a set of Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw). The environment
						is filled with spherical obstacles that the robot must avoid in reaching the obstacle.</p>

					<p class="project-tile-description">This project is an extension of "3D State Estimation and Control" as

						focus
						on state estimation in the presence of sensor noise and occlusion. The goal is to use an Extended
						Kalman
						filter to produce optimal estimates of the position, orientation, and velocity of the artifact using
						noisy data of the markers on the corners of the artifact.</p>
