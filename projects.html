								<h1 class="project-title">Inverse Kinematics Using Optimization</h1>
								<p class="project-description">Through the use of function optimization in MATLAB, the position and orientation of a 3-dimensional snake robot is controlled in order to reach into an environment and grasp an object. The snake robot consists of a serial chain of kinematic links, of arbitrary number and length, where each joint is controlled with a set of Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw). The environment is filled with spherical obstacles that the robot must avoid in reaching the obstacle.</p>

								<h1 class="project-title">Inverted Pendulum Control</h1>
								<p class="project-description">This project regards dynamics, control, and robot learning techniques to both model and control a cart pole (inverted pendulum) system through the use of a simulated dynamics engine. The cart has a mass of 1kg and a horizontal rocket thruster to move in the horizontal x-direction. A pole is attached to the cart with a joint. It has a mass of 0.1kg and is 1m long (and is infinitely thin).</p>

								<h1 class="project-title">3D State Estimation and Control</h1>
								<p class="project-description">This project deals with tracking/representing the 3D orientation and dynamics of an “alien artifact” tumbling through space. The goal is to use markers on the corners of the artifact to estimate its dynamics and future trajectory. Finally, we are to control a spacecraft to land just above the surface of the artifact as it tumbles through space.</p>

								<p class="project-description">This project deals with estimating the state of an “alien artifact” tumbling through space. The goal is to use Kalman filtering to produce optimal estimates of the position, orientation, and velocity of the artifact using noisy data of  the markers on the corners of the artifact. Furthermore, additional sections involve using an Extended Kalman Filter to process nonlinear dynamics as well as utilizing SLAM techniques to estimate marker locations when global state data is not given.</p>
